# Fake News Detection System

This project implements a fake news detection model using classical machine learning techniques.

## Overview
The model classifies news articles as fake or real based on their textual content.

## Approach
- Text feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Classification using Logistic Regression

## Dataset
Fake and Real News Dataset (Kaggle)

## Results
The model achieved approximately 94–98% accuracy on the test dataset.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Upload Fake.csv and True.csv in Google Colab
2. Open and run `fake_news_detection.ipynb`
